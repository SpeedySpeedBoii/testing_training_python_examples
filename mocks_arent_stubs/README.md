This project contains the examples from the article "Mocks aren't stubs" by Martin Fowler, rewritten in python.

Here is a mapping between sections in the article and files:
- Regular Tests: tests/test_order_regular.py
- Tests with Mock Objects: tests/test_order_mock.py
- The Difference Between Mocks and Stubs:
  - First example: tests/test_order_regular.py
  - Second example: tests/test_order_mock.py
